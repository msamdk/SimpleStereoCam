# SimpleStereoCam

This is a project that i did to improve my understanding of making a stereo camera and calibrate it to estimate distances of objects from the camera.
In the project i used two identical Microsoft modern webcams. I designed a frame for the camera setup using blender and 3D printed it.

## What do you need for the project?
1. Two cameras in the same model to prevent any mismatches in focal length, latency and other external and internal features
2. 3D printer (optional if you need a nice frame for the camera)
3. Calibration board (chess board image printed) - 9x6, 10x7 with known square size measurements
4. Computer with python installed and necessary libraries

## Lets get familiar with camera calibration

You can follow this youtube channel to understand the mathematics behind camera calibration which is highly important to understand the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters of the camera
